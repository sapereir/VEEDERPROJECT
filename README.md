# VEEDER PROJECT
Created a model to determine the amount of fuel losses due to liquid leaks and 
vapor losses in Fuel Tanks. Designed an algorithm that utilizes fuel tank
data to exploit vapor-liquid equilibrium understandings to correlate 
thermodynamic properties to tank height, and vapor volume. This algorithm 
utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms such as logistical regression 
to create these correlations.
